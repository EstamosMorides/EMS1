### Vehicles
#### <a id="v1"></a>[AOO vehicles][v1]
![v1img]<br>
AOO Vehicles Stand Alone! Pre release of some of the Vehicles coming to the A21 Release of Age of Oblivion.

6 Derby Cars and 3 Sports Cars
Cars are found in the world.
They are locked and must be lock picked in order to have a chance at getting a drivable version.
Sports cars have a lower chance to be driveable.

Derby cars are "Low Quality"  Less durability, not as fast and smaller Gas Tanks

### Quality of Life
#### <a id="qol1"></a>[Feel - Better Stacks][qol1]
![qol1img]<br>
Boost your inventory efficiency in 7 Days To Die with the Feel - Better Stacks mod! I've increased stack sizes for all items and blocks by **2x**

#### <a id="qol2"></a>[Better Resource Harvest][qol2]
![qol2img]<br>
The raw material yield is slightly changed by this mod. There are no longer fixed values ​​like in the vanilla version, but range values ​​that are slightly below and above vanilla. The skills also give a small bonus like in the vanilla. 

<p>As an example: the iron block (decorative) gives 105 iron without skills after mining (vanilla), now the iron block gives between 95 and 171 iron with a small chance of a bonus iron after mining and in addition all ores (decorative blocks), gold nugget, silver nugget and raw diamond can now drop with a low probability and with the skill book.</p>

#### <a id="ocb"></a>[Oakraven - Bee Hives][oc]
![ocb]<br>
The Oakraven Bee Hives Mod allows players to receive honey comb through bee keeping. A Queen Bee is required to activate a Bee Hive. Queen Bees can only be found in the Pine Forest from Bee Logs.

#### <a id="occ"></a>[Oakraven - Chicken Coops][oc]
![occ]<br>
The Oakraven Chicken Coops allow players to receive feathers, eggs, and grown domestic chickens from eggs. To activate a Coop, use 2 caught chicks found in birds’ nests.

#### <a id="ocd"></a>[Oakraven - Rock Drill][oc]
![ocd]<br>
This mod allows us to mine for resources.

It can be unlocked after reaching level 60/100 of Workstations Crafting Skill at a Tier 4 type item that is in the same area as the Chemistry Table.

The loot.xml governs what kind and how much resource is provided to players after a drilling cycle. An Oakraven Rock Drill requires a Rock Drill Gas Can to power it for each cycle.

#### <a id="qol3"></a>[Working Ovens][qol3]
![qol3img]<br>
The modification allows you to repair ovens from the vanilla version. To fix it, you will need a repair kit X1 and a repair tool (a Hammer or its analogues). After the repair, things will disappear from the container (If they were in the storage).
The subordinate "Bonfire" can be picked up or broken up for further storage/transfer.
List of furnaces available for restoration:
* Built-in oven (All options)
* Wood-burning stove
* Old stove (All options)
* Modern stove (All options)
* Gas stove (All options)

#### <a id="qol4"></a>[CTVI Dew Collectors][qol4]
![qol4img]
![qol4img2]<br>
This adds two new dew collectors with some extra progression for players. The purpose is to help reduce performance impacts to servers. It is pure server side mod but can also be used in single player.

You unlock the new collectors by reading forge ahead at level 3 and 10
You then hand in existing collectors plus iron for silver or steel or gold to make a higher level collector which gives more water.

#### <a id="qol5"></a>[Imagine: Better Food][qol5]
![qol5img]
![qol5img2]
* 79 New food icons to replace vanilla icons
* Added MRE style food items that can only be obtained in airdrops
* Buffed all food items food/water/health amounts
* Added water to some things that I felt should have water like blueberries
